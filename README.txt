Project Name: Ultimi

Tagline: Learn smarter, not harder.

Overview:
Ultimi is an AI-powered web application designed to help students study more effectively by transforming their learning materials into personalized quizzes. Students can upload various file formats—including PDFs, Word documents, PowerPoint slides, or images of handwritten notes—and the AI intelligently extracts key information to generate interactive quizzes such as multiple-choice, true/false, and short-answer questions. The platform also features a question bank for extra practice and a leaderboard that fosters motivation through friendly competition.

Beyond enhancing learning efficiency, Ultimi promotes educational equity by offering scholarships and financial support to underprivileged but hardworking students. Sponsored by organizations and partners, the system rewards the top 27 students on its yearly leaderboard, with the number of scholarships increasing as the user base grows. In the long term, Ultimi aims to evolve into a global academic social network where students across all levels can collaborate, share knowledge, and even earn financial rewards for their academic performance and engagement.
